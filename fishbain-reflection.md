###What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

* I was struggling with the conceptual differences between pushing and pulling and when exactly to do each. I am also not sure if you are supposed to merge branches locally prior to pushing and submitting a pull request. I have a feeling that it will all become more clear with more practice though! Additionally, I am a bit confused about how to link a picture (to our markdown file) locally; without using the URL. Merge conflict was a new concept to me as well. I understand what it is but am still working on conceptualizing exactly how to solve it.  

###What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

* I now have a better grasp on when and how to push and pull to GitHub.  In the past, I had always merged to master in my terminal prior to pushing up to GitHub.  We also asked our guide how fetch and merge are different than just pulling, which he gave a good explanation for.  This was my first experience as the "navigator", and I found it to be very helpful to watch and give input; similarly to how driving was helpful in my peer-pairing session.

###What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

* We asked our guide a lot of questions regarding the steps in the process to push and pull.  Also, as mentioned above, he clarified the difference between fetch/merge and pull.  Our guide also walked us through cloning the repo onto our local computer and explained some shortcuts to doing so.  I only wish we had more time so we were able to ask some more questions regarding the merge conflict.

###What still confuses you about Git?

* Due to the hurried nature of the end of our pair, I would like a little more time reviewing merge conflict.  Additionally, embedding a local image in a file (using markdown) was difficult.  As I stated earlier, everything is still processing and I think more and more practice will help solidify the processes in my head.  I have gotten a lot better at using the documentation provided and searched for online.  Specifically, I would like to continue working on push/pull practices, forking/cloning, and certain markdown features.

###How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

* This experience was very helpful.  I signed up directly after completing my first peer-pairing session and I found it to be helpful to have a=one under my belt prior to the GPS.  Amy and I communicated very well and were patient with one another.  We were working at a similar pace and had the same questions for Peter, our guide.  I have an in person peer-pairing session today, and am anxious to see how it will function differently.  Hangouts worked well for the most part, and screen sharing was effective as well.  As I stated earlier, I only wish that with the initial GPSs, we could have more than an hour with our guide.
